In Java, static final variables are used to define constants. These variables are:

static: Belong to the class, not to any specific instance, so they can be accessed without creating an object.
final: Their value cannot be changed after initialization, making them immutable constants.
Using static final is a common practice for defining constants such as mathematical values or fixed configurations.

public class CircleCalculator {
    // Define constants using static final
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double radius = 5.0; // Radius of the circle

        // Calculate area and circumference
        double area = PI * radius * radius; // Area formula: πr²
        double circumference = 2 * PI * radius; // Circumference formula: 2πr

        // Display results
        System.out.println("Circle with radius " + radius + ":");
        System.out.println("Area = " + area);
        System.out.println("Circumference = " + circumference);
    }
}


Output:
Circle with radius 5.0:
Area = 78.53975
Circumference = 31.4159
